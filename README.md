Decompiling tool made for Construct Classic

# Installation
## Dependencies

DeConstruct Classic requires [.NET 9.0's Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0).

After running the x64 installer, you may proceed with the installation.

## Installing a precompiled artifact

To install an artifact, you must be logged into a Github account, then you must make your way over to [Actions](https://github.com/SunkenStudios/DeconstructClassic/actions), and from there select the latest workflow **marked with the word `master`**. On that page, if you scroll down you should find `Artifacts`, from there just click on `DeConstruct Classic` and it will start downloading.

> [!NOTE]  

> As actions expire after a while, you may need to compile DeConstruct Classic yourself.

Once it's downloaded, extract the .zip file to an empty folder, and then run `DeconstructClassic.exe`.
